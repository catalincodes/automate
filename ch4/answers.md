7. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
8. [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

10. append adds an entry at the end of the list. insert adds an entry at a 
specific positiongiven via a parameter
11. You can remove using the .remove method or del statement followed by the 
entry. With .remove you need the contents of the element you want to remove. 
With del you need to know the index of the element you want to remove
12. They both have a length and you can access elements from their arrays

cannot be altered.

15. If I have list `eggs` and I do tuple(eggs), it will transform the eggs into
a tuple. The other way around can be done by using the list function: 
`list(tuple(eggs))`
16. A reference to the address in memory of the list
17. Copy can copy mutable values like lists or dictionaries, but if your lists have sub-lists (or the dictionary has sub-lists or other mutable values) then you need a deepcopy.
